# 📊 Mutual Fund Analysis using Python

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **mutual fund investment data** using Python.  
The aim is to explore **investment patterns, preferences, and objectives** of participants and uncover insights through statistical analysis and visualizations.

---

## ✅ Tasks Performed

### **Task 1: Numerical Analysis**
- Identified numeric columns such as `age`, `mutual_funds`, `equity_market`, etc.  
- Performed descriptive statistics using:  
  - `describe()` → summary statistics  
  - `mean()`, `median()`, `std()` → central tendency and spread  
  - `to_numeric()` → handled non-numeric data  

---

### **Task 2: Investment Avenues (Initial Analysis)**
- Analyzed investments using plots.  
- Key Insight: Most investments were in **Gold** followed by **Government Bonds**.  
- Preference: Gold and Government Bonds.  

---

### **Task 3: Investment Avenues (Frequency Analysis)**
- Extended Task 2 by adding **frequency counts** above each plot.  
- Reconfirmed Gold and Government Bonds as top investment avenues.  

---

### **Task 4: Reasons for Investment**
- **Equity Market** → Capital appreciation  
- **Mutual Funds** → Better returns  
- **Fixed Deposits** → Risk-free option  
- **Government Bonds** → Assured returns (low tax incentives)  

---

### **Task 5: Savings Objectives**
- Majority of participants’ **primary savings objective**: **Retirement Planning**  

---

### **Task 6: Financial Consultants**
- **Pie Chart** analysis showed that **financial consultants** were the most useful source of guidance for participants.  

---

### **Task 7: Data Sources**
- Analyzed and visualized **common data sources** using bar plots.  
- Compared distribution across different investment avenues.  

---

### **Task 9: Expectations vs Gender**
- Explored the **Expectations column** with gender distribution.  
- Found that **20%-30% return expectation** was very common.  
- Displayed breakdown across multiple investment avenues.  

---

### **Task 10: Correlation Analysis**
- Analyzed correlation between **Duration** and **Expectation** with respect to **Age**.  
- Used **scatter plots** to highlight relationships.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning & statistical analysis  
- **NumPy** → Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive analysis
